# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of the Project
The goal of this analysis was to use Kickstarter data to determine how successful various campaigns were based on their start date as well as their funding goals. 
### Purpose
Using the Kickstarter data, the objective was to determine which elements might make a theater oriented campaign more successful. The client for the study was hoping to establish a play and was looking for some insights into which start dates and which goal amounts lead to the highest chances of success for her particular campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this section a pivot table was created first with fields filled out as such: Filters (Parent Category, Year), Columns (Outcomes), Values (Count of Outcomes), Rows (Date Created Conversion). From here, a line chart was created from the data in the pivot table, which can be seen below. The chart shows us that the month with the highest number of successful theater campaigns was May, with a steady decline from this point until the end of the year. Coincidentally, May also has the highest number of unsuccessful theater campaigns, but this number remains more consistent across the year compared to the successful campaign numbers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal
In this section, data is pulled from the Kickstarter dataset in order to create a table which contains the number of successful, failed, canceled and total campaigns as well as the kpercentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. From these figures, a line chart was established displaying the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on goal amounts. This chart is pictured below. Within this line chart it shows that the highest percentage of successful campaigns falls under those that have a goal amount of $1000 or less. Conversely, the highest percentage of failed campaigns falls under the those that have a goal amount of $45000 - $49999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A possible challange that could be faced when trying to determine the outcomes based on the month the campaign started is establishing the correct pivot table. Understanding the dimensions of the pivot table and how they interact with eachother can be difficult to conceptualize, and because of this, it could be a struggle determining which columns from your dataset should populate each field. To overcome this, I would reccomend playing around with different variables in each field and see how they change the pivot table. This should help with familiarization with parameters of each field contained in the pivot table. Regarding the outcomes based on goals, a difficulty that I faced was establishing the proper *Countifs()* function. There are multiple ranges and pieces of criteria to consider within the function, and I personally had a hard time formatting the function as well as making sure I included the correct components. To remedy this, I took a second to really consider each section of the function an established what exactly I was trying to accomplish. Instead of thinking about the function as a whole, I broke it down into parts and this helped add clarity to process for me. 
## Results
### Outomes Based on Launch Date
The line chart for outcomes based on launch date shows us that the most successful campaigns happened in May with a somewhat steady decline until the end of the year. Based on this we would want to reccommend to our client that May would be the best start date for a theater campaign, but, after digging a little deeper, this may not be the case. May also contains the highest number of failed theater campaigns, and based on this alone it would seem sensible to reccommend to the client to avoid starting in this month. I think a more effective chart would show the percentage of failed, successful and canceled campaigns. This would take into consideration the number of campaigns started per month, and would alleviate the dilema of having one month with both the highest number of failed and successful campaigns. 
### Outcomes Based on Goal
The line chart for outcomes based on goal shows us that the campaigns with the highest success rate can be found on the left side of the chart where the lower goal amounts can be found. Conversely, the campaigns with the highest failed rates can be found on the right side of the chart where the higher goal amounts can be found. This seems intuitive that the more expensive it is to fund something that it will have a higher chance of failing. Based on this dataset alone though, I wouldn't feel completely confident making that conclusion, even though it's likely the case. There are 16 or fewer campaigns in each of the last six goal amount ranges, which brings the sample size into question. Ideally, we would have thousands of campaign ranges, but here, having so few makes it difficult to rule out the possiblity of these outcomes being annomolous.
